# 2020_Antibody_ThermoCalc_JY_v0.0 (20/07/13)
 
## Description
This code calculates thermodynamic properties of antigen-antibody system with weak-bidning linkers. Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) method are used for the thermodynamic approach. The project is under supervision of Prof.Won-Ki Cho & Prof.Byung-Ha Oh

## Requirement
MATALB(>2019)
Parallel Computing Toolbox(https://kr.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/index.html)

## Overview
(To be updated)

## Demo
See Demo_SingleRun_ThermoCalc.m & Demo_Kd2Change_ThermoCalc.m

## Contact
The code and README is written by Jinyeop Song(KAIST, Department of Physics, yeopjin@kaist.ac.kr)
