# 2020_Antibody_ThermoCalc_JY_v0.0 (20/07/13)
 
## Description
This code is for calculating thermodynamic property of antibody system under precense of weak-bidning linkers. For the thermodynamic approach, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations are used. The project is supervised under Prof.Won-Ki Cho & Prof.Byung-Ha Oh

## Requirement
MATALB(>2019)
Parallel Computing Toolbox(https://kr.mathworks.com/help/parallel-computing/index.html)

## Overview
To be updated

## Demo
See Demo_SingleRun_ThermoCalc.mat & Demo_Kd2Change_ThermoCalc.mat

## Contact
The code and README is written by Jinyeop Song(KAIST, Department of Physics, yeopjin@kaist.ac.kr)
